# exploring-text-data-tweets

In this project firs, I read tweets which are stored in the CSV file using pandas library. The tweets are then cleaned to remove noise from the tweets like RT, &amp, <Ut..> and stopwords. Then the frequency of occurence of the words are calculated. Using the frequency information, word cloud is created using python library that gives an overall better understanding of which is the most talked about topics or personalities in the tweets captured in the CSV file.
